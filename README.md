### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- Currently there is a lack of qualified, retirement-ready employees in their respective departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. 
- Only 1,550 employees are eligible for mentoring to help fill the 90,000+ vacant roles projected in the coming years. 
- That equates to an average of ~58 employees to mentor for each retiring position. 
- We believe this ratio to be too extreme for retiring employees to adequately train the next generation of workers and a organizational plan is needed to remedy the situation.
